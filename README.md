# P3MyStore

There aren't many instructions to share on this project:

1. clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/evolaric/p3-My-Store.git`
2. run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. run `ng serve` from the command line to serve the project

The testing specs were generated automatically, but contain no tests as they were not a requirement for this project.

The component css files were left intact even though I used global styles in most cases.
